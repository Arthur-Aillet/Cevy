## What is C++evy?

C++evy is an entity component system game engine built in C++, and try to be the C++ alternative of Rust's Bevy!

Make sure to check Bevy: https://bevyengine.org/

## WARNING

Cevy is still in the early stages of development and being developed for a school project it will probably stay this way.

## Design Goals

* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like

## Docs

We use *Doxygen* for our doc, you can `make doc` and open `index.html` to see it ! (We'll maybe host it in the future ?)
